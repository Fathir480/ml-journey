# ML Journey

This repository documents my long-term journey to deeply understand
Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.

## Goals
- Build strong fundamentals in mathematics, statistics, and programming
- Understand ML algorithms from first principles
- Develop research-oriented and engineering mindset
- Maintain a transparent learning journal

## Structure
- `journal/` → daily and weekly learning reflections
- `notebooks/` → experiments and implementations
- `resources/` → references and notes

## Philosophy
I prioritize understanding over speed.
This repository reflects my thinking process, mistakes, and growth.
